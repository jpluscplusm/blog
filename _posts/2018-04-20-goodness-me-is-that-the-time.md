title: "Goodness me, is that the time?"

Well, after an entirely unforced absence of ... *some* years, it's time to get
this blog going again!

There will be a few teething issues to begin with, as I remember how much I
dislike writing anything in the HTML/CSS/JS space, and I suspect anyone
following this via a feed reader will have the entire back catalog spammed at
them. Apologies - that'll be something to do with moving across to Jekyll-based
hosting and site generation, and I'm not sure it's worth fixing :-)

If you notice anything hideously wrong (**outside** the realm of the words I
write!) please do let me know via the usual channels.

Also, please consider any blog post older than this one (pre-2018) to be
sufficiently old that I renounce and retract anything meaningful written
therein. I'll get round to putting them in an "old'n'busted" category sometime,
but please rest assured I no longer have any professional interest in Jenkins,
RHEL, CentOS, or VBS! Those posts are there as a reminder that we all grow,
learn and move on :-)

Until next time,

Jon
